# Hangman Program
This program is a Hangman game.

The program will take a word from the 'dictionary.txt' file and the user will have to guess what the word is.

The words in the 'dictionary.txt' file can be updated or changed. The included 'aREADME.txt' file gives the description about what words are allowed in the program.

*Note: To ensure the program will run, make sure the 'dictionary.txt' file is included into the .exe folder location.*
