# Data Entry Program
This program takes user input and saves it to a text file ('userdata.txt'). The information consists of name, age, job, and pay.

The use of this program allows the user to read or update the data from 'userdata.txt'.

The program updates data by creating a 'userdata2.txt' buffer file, deletes the old file, and renames 'userdata2.txt'.

There is a supplied test data 'userdata.txt' file for those whom are interested. It is not required since the program creates a new file if no file exists.
