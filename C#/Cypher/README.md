# Cypher Program (C#)
This program allows the user to create a text file of his/her choosing. Upon doing so, the user is able to enter any text he/she wants into it. The program will then convert the letters over to ASCII numbers so that it can be "hidden" from prying eyes.

This program also allows the user to enter the text file name and it will read the ACII text as letter text.

There is a supplied 'test.txt' file for those whom are interested, or you can create your own file.
