# Hangman Game (C#)
This program will start a game where the user guesses a word by entering in letter by letter.

The user will only get so many guesses as long as the word is (5-letter word = 5 guesses).

Should the user fail to reveal the word in the guesses allowed, he/she loses. Otherwise, he/she will win.
